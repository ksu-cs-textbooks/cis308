However, suppose weâ€™re in our main function and we call a function from a different file? This is just like calling a C library function without using any include statements. The compiler will not know where to find the outside function.
To solve this within the C libraries, function prototypes are placed in header files (.h files). The functions themselves are implemented in corresponding .c files. If I want to use a C library function, I include the appropriate header file so that the compiler knows about the function.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis308/5-chapter/5_1-headerfiles/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
