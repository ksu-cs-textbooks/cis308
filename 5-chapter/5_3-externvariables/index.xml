Here’s how to do this:
Declare the global variable in a .h file. This can either be done in a .h file with some of your function prototypes, or in a special file, globals.h, that contains the declarations of all global variables. If you do use a special globals header file, it does not need a corresponding .c file. Include the .h file wherever you want to use the variable When you want to use the variable, declare: extern type name; where type is the type of the global variable, and name is its name. The extern keyword tells the compiler not to create a new variable, but instead to find the variable name declared in another file.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis308/5-chapter/5_3-externvariables/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
