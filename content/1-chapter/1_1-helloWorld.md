The first program students write in any new language is the "Hello, World"
program. Hereâ€™s how it looks in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() 
{
	printf("Hello, World!\n");
	return 0;
}
```


To write and run this program see the *Visual Studio guide* for more information. It should print "Hello, World!" to the console.
