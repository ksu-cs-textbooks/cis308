# Pointers to Functions
<div align="left">
The	pointers we	have looked	at	so	far	have	all	been	pointers	to	various	types	of	data	objects,	
(such	as	int,	char,	double,	struct	person,	and	pointer-to-int),	but	it	is	also	possible	to	have	
pointers	to	functions.	Pointers	to	functions	are	useful	for	approximately	the	same	reasons	as	
pointers	to	data:	when	you	want	an	extra	level	of	indirection, or	when	you'd	like	the	same	piece	of	
code	to	call	different	functions	depending	on	circumstances.
