This is the textbook for CIS 308, *C Language Lab*, at Kansas State University. The course assumes students have significant programming background in a high-level language like C# or Java. It also assumes familiarity with common data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, binary search trees, hash tables, and graphs) and their implementations.
