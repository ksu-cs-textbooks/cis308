It would be much nicer to be able to call them just person or grade. With Câ€™s typedef construct, we can do just that.
The format of typedef is:
typedef oldType newType;Here, we rename type oldType to the new name newType. We can now create variables using the name newType. For example:
typedef char letterGrade; letterGrade g; g = 'A';Notice that we treat our new letterGrade type just like it was a char.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis308/6-chapter/6_3-typedef/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
