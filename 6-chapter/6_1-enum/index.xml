For instance, in Java we might declare:
public static final int GOLD = 1; public static final int SILVER = 2; public static final int BRONZE = 3; ..but really what we want is to create a “medal” type that can take on the values GOLD, SILVER, and BRONZE. Moreover, we want GOLD to mean “1”, SILVER to mean “2”, and BRONZE to mean “3”.
(Note: Java does have enums available in its latest version, which are handled very similarly to how they are in C.)</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis308/6-chapter/6_1-enum/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
