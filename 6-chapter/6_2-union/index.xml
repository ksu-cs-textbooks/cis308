A union variable can only hold one value at a time, unlike a struct, but that value is not restricted to a single type.
Here’s the format for declaring a union:
union modelName { type1 name1; type2 name2; ... typeN nameN; } objectList;Here, modelName is the name of the type you’re creating, each type name is a type you want to be able to store in this union plus a name for it, and objectList is a list of variables you want to create with this union type.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis308/6-chapter/6_2-union/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
