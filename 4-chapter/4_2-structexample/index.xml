This way, the struct type can be used throughout the file.
Here is an example that uses a struct to store a two-dimensional point (x, y location). It gets two points as input, and then prints the equation that passes through the points.
#include &lt;stdio.h> struct point { int x; int y; }; //No variables declared here double getSlope(int, int, int, int); double getIntercept(int, int, double); int main() { struct point p1; struct point p2; double slope; double intercept; printf("Enter point1, e.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis308/4-chapter/4_2-structexample/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
