(They are like static methods in Java and C#.) They take a number of parameters, perform on operation on those parameters, and may or may not return a value.
Function Prototypes Some C compilers will complain if they see a call to a function before they’ve seen the function itself. To avoid this problem, it’s best to include a prototype for a function at the top of the file, and then to implement it someplace else in the file.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis308/1-chapter/1_7-functions/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
