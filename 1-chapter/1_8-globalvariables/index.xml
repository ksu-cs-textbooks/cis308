These variables are only visible within that function.
Consider this function:
int count(void) { int sum = 0; sum++; return sum; } Each time we call count, the sum variable is set back to 0, and the return value is 1. sum does not retain its value across function calls.
If we did want this function to keep track of how many times it had been called, we could store sum as a global variable. Global variables are declared outside any function, and are visible to any function in the same file:</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis308/1-chapter/1_8-globalvariables/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
