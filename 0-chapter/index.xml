      <description>VS Code In CIS 308, we will edit our C programs using VS Code with C/C++ extensions. You likely already have Visual Studio (2019 or 2022) installed on your computer from CIS 300 and/or 400 &amp;ndash; however, we will not be using Visual Studio in CIS 308. While it does have a C++ compiler, it behaves differently than more widely accepted C compilers (versions of gcc and clang). Finally, this class has a secondary goal of exposing students to a variety of Unix/Linux tools &amp;ndash; something that cannot be done as easily in Visual Studio.</description>

      <description>After you have installed VS Code along with gcc, you can write C programs in the VS Code editor and then use the integrated terminal to compile and run.
Hello, World! in VS Code Here is a Hello, World! program written in C using VS Code. It is saved to the file hello.c (note that .c is the extension for C programs):
Find code in terminal To compile and run a C program, make sure the integrated terminal appears below the code in VS Code (as shown above).</description>

      <description>This class will use GitHub links to create initial repositories for both labs and programming projects, similarly to what you have done in CIS 300 and 301.
GitHub account First, you will need to create a GitHub account here. If you already have one, you can use your existing account.
Verify a git install You will likely already have a command-line version of git installed on your machine. To check, open a folder in VS Code, display the integrated terminal, and type:</description>
