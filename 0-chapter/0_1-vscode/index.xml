You likely already have Visual Studio (2019 or 2022) installed on your computer from CIS 300 and/or 400 – however, we will not be using Visual Studio in CIS 308. While it does have a C++ compiler, it behaves differently than more widely accepted C compilers (versions of gcc and clang). Finally, this class has a secondary goal of exposing students to a variety of Unix/Linux tools – something that cannot be done as easily in Visual Studio.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis308/0-chapter/0_1-vscode/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
