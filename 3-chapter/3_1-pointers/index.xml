They have an associated type of what kind of value they reference.
Pointers are one of the most difficult concepts in the C language. However, mastering pointers allows you do have a deeper understanding of what actually happens when your program runs. Higher-level languages do not explicitly use pointers, but they do use pointers “behind the scenes”. Learning pointers in C can also help you understand what’s going on in Java/C#/etc. programs.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis308/3-chapter/3_1-pointers/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
