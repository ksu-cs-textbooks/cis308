(We can take it even further than that, but it starts to get pretty confusing!) You can denote the “level” of the pointer by how many *’s you use in the declaration.
Here’s an example of using pointers to pointers:
int i; //declares the int i int *ip; //declares the int pointer ip int **ipp; //declares a pointer to a pointer to an int, ipp i = 36; //gives i the value 36 ip = &amp;i; //now ip points to i *ip = 72; //dereferences ip to get i, and sets it to 72 (now i=72) ipp = &amp;ip; //ipp points to ip, which points to i **ipp = 24; //dereferences ipp to get ip, then dereferences again to get i, //and sets it to 24 (now i = 24)</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis308/3-chapter/3_4-pointerstopointers/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
