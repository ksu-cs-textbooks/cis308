int i; int nums[10]; for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) { nums[i] = 0; } However, now that we can treat arrays like pointers, there is a different way to initialize array elements:
int *ip; int nums[10]; for (ip = nums; ip &lt; nums+10; ip++) { *ip = 0; } Here, ip is a pointer that starts by pointing to the first element in the array. We loop while the value of ip (the memory address) is less than nums+10 â€“ which is the address of the last element in the array. Each time, ip++ advances ip to point at the next element in the array. Inside the loop, we dereference ip to get the current array element, and set that element to 0.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis308/3-chapter/3_3-interationwithpointers/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
